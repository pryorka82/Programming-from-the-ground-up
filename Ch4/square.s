#PURPOSE - This program computes the square of the number given
# 	   example  3,  3 * 3 = 9

.globl square #this is unneeded unless we want to share 
		 #this function among other programs
_start:
pushl $10	#The square takes one argument - the number we want
		#a square of.  So, it gets pushed
call square     #run the square function
addl $4, %esp   #Scrubs the parameter that was pushed on the stack

movl %eax, %ebx #square returns the answer in %eax, but we want it
		#in %ebx to sent it as our exit status

movl $1, %eax 	#call the kernel's exit function
int $0x80

#This is the actual function definition
.type square, @function
square:
pushl %ebp	#standard function stuff - we have to restore %ebp to its
		#prior state before returning, so we have to push it
movl %esp, %ebp #This is because we don't want to modify the stack pointer
		#so we use %ebp
movl 8(%ebp), %eax #This moves the first argument to %eax
		   # 4(%ebp) holds the return address, and
		   # 8(%ebp) holds the first parameter
imull %eax, %eax   # multiply %eax value by itself

movl %ebp, %esp	#standard function return stuff - we
popl %ebp	#have to restore %ebp and %esp to where they were before the
		#function started 
ret		#return to the function (this pops the return value too
